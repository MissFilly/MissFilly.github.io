As perhaps you know, Stanford University offered three online courses for free that started in October: [Introduction
to Artificial Intelligence][1], [Machine Learning][2] and [Introduction to Databases][3].

Well, it seems they have been a success, because Stanford is offering new courses that start next January and February.
These are:

- [Human-computer Interfaces][4], by Scott Klemmer. It starts January 2012\.  

- [Natural Language Processing][5], by Chris Manning and Dan Jurafsky. It starts January 2012\.  

- [Game Theory][6], by Matthew Jackson and Yoav Shoham. It starts January 2012\.  

- [Probabilistic Graphical Models][7], by Daphne Koller. It starts January 2012\.

- [Machine Learning][8], by Andrew Ng. It starts January 2012\.  

- [Cryptography][9], by Dan Boneh. It starts January 2012\.  

- [Design and Analysis of Algorithms I][10], by Tim Roughgarden. It starts January 2012\.  

- [Computer Science 101][11], by Nick Parlante. It starts February 2012\.

- [Software Engineering for Software as a Service][12], by Armando Fox and David Patterson. It starts February 2012\.  

I couldn't be any happier about the posibility to access these courses for free as part of an open education initative.
