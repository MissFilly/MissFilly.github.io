I made some designs for [Electronic Frontier Foundation][0] T-shirts. These are for my personal use, with the purpose
of spreading the ideas of digital rights and privacy, and getting people to know about the EFF.

The file contains the .svg of all designs together. **These are not perfect designs**, their objective is to give a
basic idea of what the T-shirts would look like, and therefore objects may not be perfectly aligned. You can change,
move, erase and scale all of them if you need to, without losing resolution. If you need to add some text, the font
used in the EFF slogan is called FF DIN Condensed Bold. 

This is how the .svg file looks like:

Big thanks to [@MarilynPi][3], [@shinax][4], who gave me the name of the EFF slogan text font, and [@fisadev][5],
[@gbytz][6], [@noahfecks][7], [@yoluismario][8], [@renzocarbonara][9] and [@TomasNeme][10] for their feedback.
