As we know, JavaScript is a class-less language that requires no specific code structure to work. As a perfectionist
that gets goosebumps every time that sees unorganized undocumented messy code (_specially_ if I myself wrote that
code!), I've relied on several free resources to learn to keep my JavaScript code clean, readable and organized.  

I wanted to share the list of the best ones I found:  

* [Writing Testable JavaScript][0] (article, by Rebecca Murphey)
* [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns][1] (book, by Addy Osmani)
* [Using Objects to Organize Your Code][2] (article, in-depth module pattern, by Rebecca Murphey)

And two awesome talks:  

#### 

#### [Testable JavaScript - Architecting Your Application for Testability by Mark Trostler][3]

My personal favourite, because it pretty much sums all previous links up. (Thank you very much to Matías Herranz for
pointing this one out to me.)

#### 

#### [(jQuery Conference 2013) Beyond the DOM: Sane Structure for JS Apps by Rebecca Murphey][4]
