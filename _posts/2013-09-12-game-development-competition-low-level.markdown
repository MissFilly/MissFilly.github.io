An interesting new miniLD (game development competition in which a single person must program a game in 48 hours) was
presented today. Its goal is to **develop (or try to develop) a game using C, C++ or assembly language**, so you have
the opportunity to have fun while understanding how the computer works. In other words, it's an educational game jam
that motivates you to learn more about low-level development (that's why it's called _Low-level jam_, duh).  

You can find all the information you need about it at the [Ludum Dare site][1].
