I should have written this post a while ago, but well, better late than never.

There is a NINJA-IDE plugins contest going on!

NINJA-IDE (which stands for "Ninja-IDE Is Not Just Another IDE") is a **free, open source** (under GPLv3 license)
Argentinian integrated development environment for the **Python** programming language. It's a great IDE, and every
day more and more people are using it.

Its creators want to **improve** this project even more. What better way to do it than encourage people to contribute
through a contest? You're able to create your own plugin for NINJA-IDE and submit it to the [official web site][1].
The contest ends **December 22nd**, and the first, second and third plugin with the highest scores will receive **U$S
250**, U$S 150 and U$S 100, respectively.

What are you waiting for? You have the opportunity to contribute to a great open source project and get a nice prize
for it! Instructions to participate in the contest can be found **[here][2]**. The tutorial for creating plugins is
**[here][3]**. You can also join the NINJA-IDE IRC channel at Freenode ([\#ninja-ide][4]) and ask any questions you
might have.
