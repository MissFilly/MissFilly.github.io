I've been using Unity since the release of Ubuntu 11.04\. It doesn't work well, it isn't really that awesome, and
I'm pretty uncomfortable with it. I recently tried to switch to GNOME 3, but somehow I missed some Unity features
besides its launcher, so I switched back. Even when Unity still works unstable for me. I think I'll always come back
for more.
