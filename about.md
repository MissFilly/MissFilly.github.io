My name is Filly, and although I'm 1.515 meters tall I don't live in a hole in the ground.
I love tons of different things, like coding, birds, sushi and playing video games.

You can follow what I'm thinking at my [Twitter][twitter] and you can
learn about my coding skills from [Stack Overflow Careers][careers] and [GitHub][github].
